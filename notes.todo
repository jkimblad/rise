Left-off:
    ☐ Make sure that the reg-ex matchings are working proparly

Throughputs:
    ☐ Calculate throughput correctly
        -Given default prefix of ports, this should be calculated something like cardinality(largest port group) * reciprocal througput
    ☐ Take care of edge-cases
        ☐ Make sure numerical prefixes are calculated correctly
            -This should be done by doing something like cardinality(largest port group)/prefix * reciprocal throughput
        ✔ Manually handle prefixes other than 'p' or numerical @done(2018-06-07 17:04) @project(Throughputs)
            -Note that there are no other prefixes other than p or numerics, this was a missunderstanding due to som of the fields containing words such as "none counted"
    ☐ Map names of instructions to LLVM-names for easier integration later 
    ☐ Consider missing fields
        ☐ No reciprocal throughput
        ☐ No ports defined
            -Right now we catch instructions that have no ports defined, but still have a througput, might have to as Mats about these, but probably these will be included in the model, but hold no resources when sheduled.
    ☐ Integrate the throughputs in the Unison codebase
        -We will need to try and automatically map the instructions to LLVM names to do this automatically.          
        -This should probably be done in the *.td files, but check with Mats or Roberto first as they might know better
        -If included in *.td, the parser Roberto wrote which converts it into .yaml probably needs to be customized.
    ☐ Remove all instructions that are 32-bit execution mode
        -Not sure if this is needed, as we get it for free. Instructions were to focus on 64 bit.
            -This needs to be taken into consideration when mapping instructions to their LLVM names, so we dont accidently map a 32-bit instruction to a 64-bit name.
    ☐ Make sure that if we find a load/store match for the port-usage, we define the resource usage separately for those ports.
        -Patterns that perform load/stores are,
            -p237 - STA
            -p23 - LD
            -p4 - STD
        -These probably hold a single resource for a single cycle

Latencies:
    ☐ Integrate the google-compiler-teams researched latencies into the llvm codebase
        -This should probably be done in the *.td files, but check with Mats or Roberto first as they might know better
